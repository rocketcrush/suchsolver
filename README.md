A 2-D Finite Volume Navier-Stokes Solver for Supersonic Flows

This project has started to fulfill the requirements of a B.Sc program.

It is able to solve steady, unsteady, viscous and inviscid problems using dual time stepping and 3rd stage Runge-Kutta method. Flux scheme is upwind type of Van Leer's flux vector splitting. All calculations are explicit meaning that all fluxes are at time level n.
